First part of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD from scratch (also known as the Maltese cross).  This tutorial covers what a Geneva Wheel is, what it's used for, how we are going to tackle the task and the start of the lock wheel.  The tutorial covers a lot of sketch work and how to use the trim tool, constrain and rotate geometry as we create the lock wheel within the sketcher workbench itself.  We will then take a break until next Wednesday video where we will continue. The video will give you the confidence and the instructions needed to get you started in creating mechanical movement projects.

Over the last two weeks I have added a couple of videos to set the scene for some of the skills we will need for making a Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. In this video I give a quick refresher on Pythagorean Theorem and how to rearrange it's equation.  This is the bear minimum we need to get us going but it's import as we will use it for our measurements

Second part of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD from scratch (also known as the Maltese cross).  This tutorial covers building the Maltese Cross template geometry.  This template will be copied and rotate to create the necessary shape needed.  Again this tutorial covers a lot of sketch work and how to use the trim tool, constrain and  rotate geometry within the sketcher workbench itself.  We will then take our usual break until next Wednesday video where we will continue where we left off and actually complete the full geometry for this part. 
The video will give you the confidence and the instructions needed to get you started in creating mechanical movement projects.

The third tutorial (part A) of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD from scratch is spread over two videos.  Each video looks at two different ways of creating the finished Maltese cross.  This one is not the best route to take. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole and though I ended up with a complete geometer the road was littered with problems. The only reason that I am leaving this one here is that it shows how to resolve issues such as constraint error and broken faces and unconnected geometry. I would recommend the other video where the geometry was completed in super quick time. The video will give you the confidence and the instructions needed to trouble shoot your own sketch issues.

The third tutorial (part B) of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD from scratch is spread over two videos. Each video looks at two different ways of creating the finished Maltese cross.  This video is the preferred route, the other video has been included as it is a good reference of how to resolve certain issues found in the sketch and part design workbench. This video covers how to use construction geometry and constraints to copy, constrain and rotate geometry and then merge this geometry into our base geometry to create the necessary shape to finish the Maltese cross. The video will give you the confidence and the instructions needed to get you started in creating mechanical movement projects.

The forth tutorial of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. This video covers how to construction the pin wheel.  We use the sketch workbench to make the necessary geometry and then use the Part Workbench to bad. We also explore how to make each sketch in separate bodies. Having more than one body allows us to pad multiple solid shapes. At the end we will have completed all the wheels and will be ready to put all the parts together to explore how these mechanisms work together. The video will give you the confidence and the instructions needed to get you started in creating mechanical movement projects.

The fifth tutorial of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. In this tutorial we will take each part of the Geneva Wheel and create compound objects so we can put them together in the part designer to discover what our finished project will look like.  We use the part workbench to create the axis rods out of simple cylinders and place them into the correct position.  We then join the lock wheel, pin wheel and pin together as one object so we can prepare the project for animation.

The sixth tutorial of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. In this tutorial we will animate the wheel so we can see the full mechanical movement in its glory.  We use the part workbench to control the visibility of our objects and swap between that and the part design workbench altering the rotational access of the master part which is automatically inherited by the compound and embedded objects.  We then use the macro feature and work out the logic and program some simple Python code to control our animation.

The seventh tutorial of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. In this tutorial we will use the Path Workbench to contour and profile our compound parts.  We use the part workbench and part workbench to convert our bodies to compound objects so we can position them to place them on our stock.  We then set up a basic milling tool and use the facing tools to create paths for cutting the individual parts.  We make use of dress ups to create holding tabs to keep our work secure as well as revisiting the stock size and adjusting it to make space for clamps.

The eighth and final tutorial of how to build a fully working Geneva Wheel in FreeCAD. In this tutorial we will use the Path Workbench to contour and profile our axes holes.  We use two different methods, a profile face and a pocket face via the part workbench. We continuing the set up a basic milling tool and use the facing tools to create paths for cutting the individual parts.  We look at spiral and zig-zag cuts, step downs etc. Then a final good luck from me for this series and until next time.
